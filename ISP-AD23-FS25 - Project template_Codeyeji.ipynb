    "**What problem are you addressing, and why is it relevant?**     \n",
    "\n",
    "In pharmaceutical manufacturing, especially during the production of pre-filled syringes and similar medical devices, visual inspection for quality control is a mandatory and highly critical step. Currently, this process is carried out manually by trained personnel who inspect each syringe for potential defects such as air bubbles, foreign particles, or missing liquid content.     \n",
    "However, manual inspection poses several challenges: it requires significant training time, is susceptible to human error, and leads to rapid visual fatigue. In real-world operations, inspectors typically need to take a break after 30 minutes of work due to eye strain. Additionally, to maximize production efficiency, manufacturing lines often run continuously—including overnight shifts—which makes it difficult and costly to rely exclusively on human labor.     \n",
    "If this process could be automated, it could address many of these issues: reducing training overhead, minimizing errors, supporting 24/7 operations, and improving overall manufacturing throughput and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What kind of image or signal data are you working with?**     \n",
    "\n",
    "We are working with RGB image data captured via webcam. The dataset includes images of syringes in various conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Reference syringes (usable)     \n",
    "(2) Syringes containing air bubbles      \n",
    "(3) Syringes with foreign objects     \n",
    "(4) Empty syringes     \n",
    "\n",
    "These images are used for both training and evaluating a classification model that determines whether a syringe is usable or defective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the main goal of your processing task?**     \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of our image processing task is to build an automated system that analyzes real-time images of syringes and determines whether each one meets usability criteria. By comparing the live input to reference examples using computer vision techniques, the system should be able to detect visual anomalies such as air bubbles, contamination, or missing liquid. Ultimately, the goal is to support or replace human inspection in pharmaceutical quality control—ensuring consistent accuracy while enabling \n",

    "\n",
    "This project was implemented in Python using several standard libraries for image processing and machine learning, primarily **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Key Libraries and Tools\n",
    "- **OpenCV**: Used for live video capture, image preprocessing, contour detection, and drawing.\n",
    "- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Used for visualization and plotting.\n",
    "- **scikit-learn**: Used to implement a basic machine learning pipeline (Random Forest classifier).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Processing Pipeline Structure\n",
    "The processing pipeline is modular and follows this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Capture**: A live video feed is accessed via `cv.VideoCapture(0)`.\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**: Each frame is converted to grayscale, smoothed using a Gaussian blur, and processed using Canny edge detection.\n",
    "3. **Contour Detection**: External contours are extracted from the edge map using `cv.findContours()`.\n",
    "4. **Filtering**: Only contours within a specified area range are retained to eliminate noise and background elements.\n",
    "5. **Bounding and ROI Saving**: Valid contours are highlighted on the video stream, and the corresponding regions (ROIs) are saved to disk.\n",
    "6. **Machine Learning Integration** (offline): A `RandomForestClassifier` is trained to distinguish between “ok” and “defect” syringe samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is encapsulated in a Python function for clarity and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Design Decisions and Parameters\n",
    "- **Canny edge thresholds**: `(30, 100)` for sensitivity to small defects.\n",
    "- **Gaussian blur kernel size**: `(5, 5)` to reduce noise while maintaining edge quality.\n",
    "- **Contour area filtering**: Only areas between `500` and `30000` pixels are considered relevant.\n",
    "- **ROI resize for ML**: Each image is resized to `64×64` for training, balancing detail with performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Challenges Encountered\n",
    "- The syringe needs to be held very close to the camera to detect fine surface defects.\n",
    "- Initial Canny thresholds were too high and failed to capture small scratches or cracks.\n",
    "- Uneven lighting conditions introduced noise; consistent illumination improved accuracy.\n",
    "- Automating the ROI extraction and naming was necessary for efficient dataset generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Modularity\n",
    "All main processing steps are implemented as standalone functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `preprocess_frame(frame)`\n",
    "- `find_valid_contours(edges)`\n",
    "- `draw_bounding_boxes(frame, contours)`\n",
    "- `save_rois(frame, contours, frame_id)`\n",
    "- `load_dataset(base_path)`\n",
